The one that stuck with me was double hashing. I would have an array of arrayLists and then each hashed value would be the index of the array and added to that given arrayList. My biggest difficulty is determining how, from there, to determine different items from one another in the arrayList. The best idea we came up with was to just hash again. |
| Oct 29 | 8:30-10pm | I spent a majority of my time, like I tend to do, mapping / drawing it out so that (1) I see my strategy laid out and (2) I can figure out how to code my solution. I'm trying to think of a solution that's better than just hashing again, but I also know that that would require redoing my whole solution. Because of this, while I tried to come up with other solutions, I decided to stick with the strategy I came up with with my table mates in class. From there, I worked on creating the 2 functions based on my solution... I'm getting some errors in regard to my data type (an array of arrayLists of arrays) and traversing through it that I will have to work on in class. |

Also, after talking with Mr. Blick, I decided to add a Pair class in my Finder class because it is faster and uses less space than an Object[] array. Now, I pass 3 of the 4 checks!! |
